## Hi there 👋

I'm an undergraduate of Class 2027 at Peking University, China, majoring in physics and minoring in Artificial Intelligence. 
In 2025Fall, I became an exchange student to Rice University, where I enjoyed a great time with friends and teachers from Rice.

From 2024, I've been working on condensed matter experiments. And starting from 2026, I'm focusing on research about condensed matter theory.
